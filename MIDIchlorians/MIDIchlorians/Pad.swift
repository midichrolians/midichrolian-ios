/**
 As only specific datatypes can be persisted, the idea is to have 4 optional properties. One
 property is an Audio, and one is an Animation Sequence, as these are what define a Pad object. 
 The other two reprsent serialised versions of the 2 structures mentioned above, and only these 2 
 serialised properties will be persisted.
 
 Using a class because Realm can't deal with structs.
