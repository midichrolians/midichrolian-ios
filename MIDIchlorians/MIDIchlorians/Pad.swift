/**
 This class represents a single Pad in a grid. A pad may have a track(audio file) and an animation
 assigned to it. A pad may also have a BPM value, indicating the number of 
 beats per minute at which the corresponding audio track plays.
 These properties are supported via optionals, since they may or may not exist. One exception
 is the BPM field, since Realm has it's own syntax for Integer optionals, which I did not want to 
 use as it causes a few issues. To someone calling the functions, the BPM property can be treated 
 as an optional, even though under the hood it is implemented differently.
 
 Using a class because Realm can't deal with structs.
